            Welcome at RelyRelay!
            <br><br><br>
            This project was intended to help people to anonymously talk to others. Often, espacially if someone is struggling with mental health issues,
            it is not the easiest to talk to friends or family - and some others do not even have that option.
            <br>
            This application was designed so that people can choose at registration if they want to offer help to others by listening to them
            and talking to them, or if they wish to recieve help by finding a set of listening "ears" (or, since it is a chat app, eyes...).
            <br><br><br>
            If you want to, you can choose both.
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            Go ahead and register, it takes 2 seconds; then have some (hopefully good) conversations! Visit the "interests" page after logging in 
            to set up topics you prefer to talk about - but this step is fully optional for the use of the application.
